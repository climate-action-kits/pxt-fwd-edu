## Activity 1: Build Your Project @showdialog
Let's build an aquatic garbage collector to help with waterway cleanup! We are going to do this in four parts: 
1. **Build** our aquatic garbage collector
2. **Add code** to bring our project to life  
3. **Modify** our project to learn about other sensors  
4. Apply what we learned with a small **challenge**

## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pluganim.webp" alt="Plug micro:bit into USB port on computer" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pairmicrobitGIF.webp"  alt="Pairing gif" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 3
Click the ``|Download|`` button to download the starter code to your project.

## Activity 3: Modify Your Project @showdialog
We have an aquatic garbage collector model with rotating motors. Let’s explore how to optimize our project by **modifying** our code!

As you go through the next steps:

* Use the instructions at the top of the screen to **modify** your code.  
* When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell Me More!'**  
* If you need help with the code, click the **lightbulb**!

## Modify Step 1
Think about the features of the aquatic garbage collectors and what they should be able to do.

~hint Tell Me More!
To help clean up aquatic waterways, our garbage collector needs to be able to: 
1. Have a power source and a way to control the collector
2. Move garbage toward the collector
3. Collect garbage in a net
4. Allow small debris like fish and plants to escape the net
hint~

## Modify Step 2
Let’s test out our aquatic garbage collector to see how it works! 

If your motors start running right away, press the logo to stop them. This will work at any point during your project.

## Modify Step 3
With your model on a table, press the **A+B** at the same time! 

What is happening? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

* The **A+B** button is an event that triggers a unique set of instructions.

* The motors spin in opposite directions to help move debris towards the model's built in **net**

* The left servo spins in one direction at 25% power.

* The right servo motor spins at 25% power in the opposite direction.

* A ``||basic:checkmark||`` displays on the micro:bit LED display. 

hint~

## Modify Step 4

Look at the difference in instructions for the **left** and **right** ``||fwdMotors:servo motors||`` 

Why do you think there are positive and negative numbers? 

~hint Tell Me More! 
* Continuous servo motors work from -100% to 100%! 
* **Negative numbers** spin in one direction, while **positive numbers** spin in the opposite direction.
* When a motor is set to 0, it doesn't spin in any direction. 
hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    // @highlight
    fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(25)
    // @highlight
    fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-25)
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
})
```

## Modify Step 5
What happens when we change the speed of the motors? 

Pick another number between 0 and 100, and change the ``||fwdMotors:motor||`` value. 

Remember to `|download|` any changes to your code to test it out!

~hint Tell Me More!
* If the number is **greater than 25**, the motor will spin faster than before
* If the number is **smaller than 25**, the motor will spin slower than before
* If there are **two different numbers** for the left and right motors, the motors will spin at two different speeds
hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    // @highlight
    fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(50)
    // @highlight
    fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-20)
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
})
```

## Activity 4: Challenge
Now that we have **modified** our code to understand how our aquatic garbage collector works, we're going to complete a small challenge! 

## Challenge Step 1
Many aquatic garbage collectors are solar-powered, which recharge using the sun's power! Let's imagine that our solar-powered model adds functionality to **sense light levels**.

What type of sensor would we need to add to our project? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

The ``||fwdSensors:solar sensor||`` can detect light in a room! 

hint~

## Challenge Step 2
Add your solar sensor to your model, and attach it somewhere to your project that gets lots of light! 

~hint Tell Me More! 
* We recommend placing the solar sensor in front of your breakout board, on the top of your model. 
* Remember to plug in your solar sensor to the **sensor port**
hint~ 

## Challenge Step 3
Let's think about the functionality we want to add to our model: 

1. When it is **cloudy**, our motors will not spin.
2. When it is **sunny**, our motors will spin!

What type of block could you add to your code to satisfy these **conditions**? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

A ``||logic:conditional statement||``! Look in the logic drawer for the "if/else" block and drag it below your code in the A+B event.

hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(25)
    fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-25)
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
    // @highlight
    if (true) {
    
    } 
    else{
    
    }
})
``` 

## Challenge Step 4 
Which block do you need to create the following condition? 

* If the sunlight is **over 50%**, turn both motors on

~hint Tell Me More! 

You'll need a ``||fwdSensors:solar||`` block to detect if the sunlight is **over 50%**!

hint~ 

```block
fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(50, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)
```

## Challenge Step 5
If the sunlight is **over 50%** we want our aquatic garbage collector to turn on. 

Which blocks should we put in our ``||logic:if||`` condition to make our code work?

~hint Tell Me More! 

We can drag the motor blocks from the **A+B** event into this condition! 
hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    if (fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(50, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(25)
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-25)
        // @highlight
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
    } 
    else(){})
```

## Challenge Step 6
If the sunlight is **not over 50%**, we want our aquatic garbage collector to turn off. 

Which blocks should we put in our ``||logic:else||`` condition to make our code work? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

We can copy the blocks from the **on logo pressed** event! 
hint~ 

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    if (fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(50, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(25)
        fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-25)
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
    } else {
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(0)
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(0)
        // @highlight
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 7

We're ready to fully **automate** our aquatic garbage collector! 

Let's remove the need to press the **A+B** button using a ``||basic:forever||`` loop. 

~hint Tell Me More! 

Drag a ``||basic:forever||`` loop into the workspace, and move all of the code blocks from the A+B event into your new loop. 

Remember to `|Download|` the code from this challenge to test your work.

hint~

```blocks
// @highlight
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(50, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(25)
        fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(-25)
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
    } else {
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(0)
        fwdMotors.rightServo.fwdSetSpeed(0)
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
    }
})
```

## Congratulations! @showdialog
You've completed the activity!

Did anything surprise you about the project?

## Reflection @showdialog
1. How does the ``||fwdSensors:solar||`` sensor value interact with the ``||logic:if/else||`` comparison to control the motors?
2. How could you add another setting to make the motors move faster on a **very sunny** day? 

## Finished! @showdialog
In the next step, you can click the ``|Done|`` button to finish the tutorial.
