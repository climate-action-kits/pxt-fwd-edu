## Activity 1: Build Your Project @showdialog
Let's build an automated smart home model to reduce energy consumption! We are going to do this in three parts: 
1. **Build** our automated smart home model   
2. **Add code** to bring our project to life  
3. **Use** your project to understand how they works

## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bits what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pluganim.webp" alt="Plug micro:bit into USB port on computer" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pairmicrobitGIF.webp"  alt="Pairing gif" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 3
Click the ``|Download|`` button to download the starter code to your project on **both** of the micro:bits in your project.

Place one micro:bit into the **breakout board in the model**, and hold one micro:bit **in your hand** throughout this project.

## Activity 3: Use Your Project @showdialog
Now that we've built our automated smart home model to help reduce energy consumption, we'll start by **using** the sample code to see how it works.

As you go through the next steps:

* **Use** the instructions at the top of the screen.  
* When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell Me More!'**  
* If you need help with the code, click the **lightbulb!**

## Use Step 1
Take a look at the physical project you just built.

What robotic components do you notice? How do you think theyâ€™ll work together to make our model function as we expect?

~hint Tell Me More!
The automated smart home model has:

* One ``||fwdMotors:servo motor||`` that rotates to unlock the front door. 

* One ``||fwdSensors:LED ring||`` to turn the lights on and off in the room. 

* One ``||fwdSensors:touch sensor||`` and one ``||fwdSensors:solar sensor||`` that we're not using **yet** but we will in the **modify** tutorial.

* These parts are connected to the **breakout board** through **cables**.

* The breakout board is connected to a **micro:bit** which holds all the code that will tell our sensors what to do and when to do it

* A second **micro:bit** holds the same code and communicates wirelessly back and forth!

hint~

## Use Step 2
Think about how smart homes in our lesson worked. 

What do you think that the micro:bit in your **model** represents inside of your house? 

What do you think that the micro:bit in your hand represents? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

* The micro:bit in your **model** represents a smart thermostat in our house. 

* The micro:bit in your **hand** represents a phone or smart app that can control automated functions in our house. 

* These micro:bits communicate using **radio waves**, similar to how most smart apps control lights in a house. 

hint~ 

## Use Step 3
Think back to our lesson about wireless communication. Which blocks do you think the two micro:bits use to communicate with each other using **radio waves**? 

~hint Tell Me More!

The ``||Radio:radio set group||`` makes sure that both micro:bits are communicating on the same radio channel.

``||Radio:radio send||`` number or string blocks **send** a message from the micro:bit you pressed a button on, to the second micro:bit.

The ``||Radio:radio received||`` number or string blocks **listen** for instructions from the micro:bit you pressed a button on.

hint~

```blocks
// @highlight
radio.setGroup(1)

input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    Temperature += -1
    basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.South)
   // @highlight
    radio.sendNumber(-1)
})

// @highlight
radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    if (receivedNumber == -1) {
        basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.South)
        Temperature += -1
    }
    if (receivedNumber == 1) {
        basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.North)
        Temperature += 1
    }
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})
```

## Use Step 4

Let's test the functionality of our **thermostat inside our house**!

Press the **A** button on the micro:bit inside your model. What do you notice happens? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

The **A** button is an **input** that triggers a set of instructions: 

1. 1 degree is subtracted from the ``||Variables:temperature||`` variable on the first micro:bit. 

2. The micro:bit ``||Basic:displays||`` an arrow pointing down.

3. The micro:bit in the model ``||radio:sends||`` the number "-1" to the micro:bit in your hand.

4. The micro:bit in your hand ``||Radio:receives||`` the number "-1" and repeats steps 2. and 3. on its ``||Basic:LED display||``.

5. Both micro:bits display the new ``||Variables:temperature||`` on their ``||Basic:LED dispalys||``. 

hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    Temperature += -1
    basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.South)
    radio.sendNumber(-1)
})

radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    if (receivedNumber == -1) {
        Temperature += -1
        basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.South)
    }
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})

basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})
```

## Use Step 5

Now let's test the same functionality with our **remote controlled app**. 

Press the **A** button using the micro:bit in **your hand**. What do you notice? 

~hint Tell Me More! 
The micro:bit in your hand sends the same message as in the previous step! 

The thermostat is now set to **1 degree Celsius cooler.**
hint~ 

```blocks 
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    Temperature += 1
    basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.North)
    radio.sendNumber(1)
})

radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    if (receivedNumber == 1) {
        Temperature += 1
        basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.North)
    }
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})

basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})
``` 

## Use Step 6

How can we **increase** the temperature of our thermostat? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

If we press the **B** button on either micro:bit, the ``||variables:Temperature||`` variable increases by 1 degree Celsius! 

hint~ 

```blocks 
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    Temperature += 1
    basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.North)
    radio.sendNumber(1)
})

radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    if (receivedNumber == 1) {
        Temperature += 1
        basic.showArrow(ArrowNames.North)
    }
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})

basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showNumber(Temperature)
})
```

## Use Step 7

Now that you understand how to adjust the **thermostat** using both micro:bits, which code blocks do you think **unlock the door** and **turns on the lights**? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

Pressing **A+B** on the **micro:bit in your hand** unlocks the door and turns on the lights remotely, like waking up in the morning, or getting home for the day! 

If the door is locked, the ``||fwdMotors:leftServo||`` turns to 100 degrees, so we can slide open the door. 

At the same time, the ``||fwdSensors:LED ring||`` turns on so we can see inside our house!

hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.House)
    // @highlight
    radio.sendString(openDoor)
})
radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if (receivedString == openDoor) {
        if (fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdGetAngle() < 100) {
            // @highlight
            fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetAngle(100)
            // @highlight
            fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xffffff)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetAngle(0)
            fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x000000)
        }
    }
})
```

## Use Step 8 

What will happen when we press **A+B** a second time? 

~hint Tell Me More! 

If the door is unlocked, pressing **A+B** sets the ``||fwdMotors:leftServo||`` to 0 degrees and the ``||fwdSensors:LEDRing||`` to black. 

This is especially helpful in conserving energy when we **go to bed** or **leave the house**. 
hint~

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.House)
    // @highlight
    radio.sendString(openDoor)
})

radio.onReceivedString(function (receivedString) {
    if (receivedString == openDoor) {
        if (fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdGetAngle() < 100) {
            fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetAngle(100)
            fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xffffff)
        } else {
            // @highlight 
            fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetAngle(0)
            // @highlight 
            fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x000000)
        }
    }
})
```
