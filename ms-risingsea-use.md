## Activity 1: Build Your Project @showdialog
Let's build a satellite to monitor sea level change! We are going to do this in four parts: 
1. **Build** our satellite  
2. **Add code** to bring our project to life  
3. **Use** sensors to understand how they work  
4. Apply what we learned with a small **experiment**

## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pluganim.webp" alt="Plug micro:bit into USB port on computer" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pairmicrobitGIF.webp"  alt="Pairing gif" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 3
Click the ``|Download|`` button to download the starter code to your project.

## Activity 3: Use Your Project @showdialog
Now that we've built our satellite to monitor sea level change, we'll start by **using** the sample code to see how it works.

As you go through the next steps:

* **Use** the instructions at the top of the screen.  
* When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell Me More!'**  
* If you need help with the code, click the **lightbulb!**

## Use Step 1
Think back to the lesson about how satellites track sea levels around the world. Our project is modelling satellite radar altimetry like [Jason-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snhFHZlbYOk).

What should it be able to do?

~hint Tell Me More!
To measure the change in sea level, our model should be able to: 

**Detect** the distance from the top of the water to the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor

**Visualize** the change in water level using the micro:bit or ``||Datalogger:data logger||``

hint~

## Use Step 2
Take a look at the physical project you just built.

What robotic components do you notice? How do you think they’ll work together to make our model function as we expect?

~hint Tell Me More!
The satellite has:

* One ``||fwdSensors:sonar sensor||`` that detects the floating circular block on the surface of the water.

* One ``||fwdSensors:touch sensor||`` that we're not using __yet__ in our code, but we will in the Modify Tutorial.

* These parts are all connected to the **breakout board** through **cables**.

* Finally, the breakout board is connected to the **micro:bit** which holds all the code that will tell our sensors what to do and when to do it!

hint~

## Use Step 3
Let’s test out our satellite to see how it can monitor sea level change!

With your model on a table, gently move your hand between the table and the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor while looking at the ``||led:LED display||`` on the micro:bit.

What is happening? 

Look at the micro:bit ``||led:LED display||``, what is happening? 

~hint Tell Me More!

When the distance between the table and the sonar sensor is **bigger**, more ``||led:LEDs||`` turn on! 

hint~

## Use Step 4
Place your hand on the table underneath the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor and gently move it closer to the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor. 

What happens to the ``||led:LEDs||`` on the micro:bit?

~hint Tell Me More! 

When the distance between your hand and the sonar sensor is **smaller**, fewer ``||led:LEDs||`` turn on!

hint~

## Use Step 5
Can you identify the **code block** that is telling the code to control the ``||led:LEDs||`` on the micro:bit?

~hint Tell Me More! 

* The micro:bit collects data from the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor. 

* The code creates a ``||led:graph||`` between 0.3 meters and your hand.

hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    WaterLevel = fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistance()
    basic.pause(1000)
   //@highlight 
   led.plotBarGraph(
    WaterLevel,
    0.3,
    true
    )
})
```

## Activity 4: Sea Level Experiment @showdialog
Now that we have **used** our code to understand how our satellite **collects data** using our hand, we're going to add water!

**Important!** 
Remember that our project uses electronic wires and sensors that should not get wet! If any part other than the building blocks gets wet, **turn off your project and fully dry it before continuing.**

## Experiment Step 1
Using craft materials, or building blocks from the Climate Action Kit, let's build a **shelf of land** for our ice to sit on! 

* **Land Ice** like glaciers sit frozen on land, and **flow** into the ocean.
* **Sea Ice** like icebergs float in the water, and are **already sitting** in the ocean when they melt. 

~hint Tell Me More

When we build a **shelf of land** for our ice to sit on, we can see how a **glacier** melting impacts sea level rise. 

1. Build your shelf of land 
2. Place your ice on top of it
3. Fill the water so that the ice sits above the water level.
hint~ 

## Build Step 17 @showdialog
To help your green circular building block float in water, wrap it with plastic wrap.

![Build Step 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/refs/heads/main/tutorial-assets/ms-risingsea-sbs17.webp) 

## Build Step 18 @showdialog
Place your model in a water tight container filled 1/4 full with **room temperature water.** 

Be careful not to drop any electronic components into the water.

![Build Step 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/refs/heads/main/tutorial-assets/ms-risingsea-sbs18.webp)

## Build Step 19 @showdialog
Fill one side of your container full of ice on top of the shelf of land that you built.

The large green rectangular building block should stop the ice from getting to the other side of the container.

![Build Step 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/refs/heads/main/tutorial-assets/ms-risingsea-sbs19.webp)

## Build Step 20 @showdialog
Place your green circular building block on the opposite side of the container. 

The circular block is like **our hand**, it should sit in the container underneath the ``||fwdSensors:sonar||`` sensor.

![Build Step 20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/refs/heads/main/tutorial-assets/ms-risingsea-sbs20.webp)


## Experiment Step 2
Leave your micro:bit on in your container of ice and water, what do you think will happen to the ``||led:LEDs||`` as the ice melts?

Write your prediction down!


## Experiment Step 3
Now it’s time to test your prediction!

As the ice melts, create a table to log how many ``||led:LEDs||`` are lit up on the micro:bit: 

1. When the ice has not melted
2. When the ice is 50% melted
3. When the ice is fully melted

~hint Tell Me More!
As the ice melts and the water rises, fewer LEDs will light up.

Depending on the size of your container, the water will rise more or less as your ice melts.
hint~

## Experiment Step 4
How much did the water level change? 

Create a graph to visualize your water level experiment.

~hint Tell Me More!
You may choose to create a bar or a line graph, with the following axes: 

* X: Percentage of Ice Melting
* Y: Level of water (Number of LED lit Up)
hint~

## Congratulations! @showdialog
You've completed the activity!

Did anything surprise you about the project or experiment that you conducted?

## Reflection @showdialog
1. How did using predictions and data collection help you better understand your code?

2. How do you think a different amount of ice would change the results of your experiment?

3. What differences did you find in the accuracy of the sonar sensor?

4. How does creating a shelf of land in your container for ice to sit on change how much your sea rose?
