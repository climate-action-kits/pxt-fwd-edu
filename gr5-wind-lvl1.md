[# Powering The Future with Wind Energy Unit 1

```
## Activity 1: Building Your Project @showdialog
Welcome to the Level 1 Wind Turbine Power Storage Project! For this project, we will use the Dial to trigger the Motor on the Wind Turbine. The Wind Turbine will turn in the same direction as the Dial is being turned and will change speeds based on the Dial's position. We will use the LED Light to tell us whether the Wind Turbine is moving clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the Dial's position.

## Coding Setp up Step 2 @showhint
Click three dots beside ``|Download|`` button, and click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

## Coding Step up Step 3 
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download the blank project to start up the simulators. 

## Coding Set up Step 4 @showdialog 
This is how the simulators should look after a successful download. You can see the Dial, and the Servo Motors alongside the Pump.
