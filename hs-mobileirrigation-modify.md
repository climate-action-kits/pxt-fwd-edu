<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/tellmore_hintbox_gif.webp" style="display: block; width: 80%; margin:auto;">

## Modify Step 1
Run the vehicle by pressing the touch sensor. Observe and document what happens.

Pay attention to how the vehicle responds. When does it stop to water? What do the LEDs indicate?

~hint Tell me more!
When the touch sensor is activated, the vehicle follows these steps:
1. Drives forward for 3 seconds.
2. Stops.
3. Turns on the green LEDs to indicate watering is about to happen.
4. Runs the pump for 1.5 seconds to water the crops.
5. Turns on the red LEDs to indicate watering is complete.

This process repeats 4 times.
hint~

```blocks
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
        basic.pause(3000)
        fwdMotors.stop()
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        basic.pause(3000)
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
    }
})
```

## Modify Step 2
What do you think would happen if you changed the values in the ``||basic:pause||`` blocks? Make a prediction.

## Modify Step 3
Let's experiment with changing the value in one ``||basic:pause||`` block at a time.

Change the pause duration in one block, ``|Download|`` the new code and observe how it influences the vehicle's behavior. Test different values and note what happens.

```block
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(10000)
        fwdMotors.stop()
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(500)
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
    }
})
```

## Modify Step 4
How do these changes influence the vehicle's watering output? What happens when you increase or decrease the pause time?

~hint Tell me more!
- The first ``||basic:pause||`` block comes before the ``||fwdMotors:stop motors||`` block. It controls how far the vehicle drives before it stops to water the crops. Increasing the pause here means the vehicle drives further between watering points, using less water.
- The second ``||basic:pause||`` block comes after the ``||fwdMotors:run pump||`` block. It allows for an appropriate delay between watering and driving forward. Decreasing this value too much (e.g. 500 ms) causes the vehicle to move forward while the pump is still running. This makes watering less precise. 
hint~

```block
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(10000)
        fwdMotors.stop()
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(500)
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
    }
})
```

## Modify Step 5
Right now, the vehicle stops at regular intervals to water the crops. What if it only stopped _after detecting a plant_? This would conserve even more water!

What changes would you need to make to the code to ensure the vehicle stops to water _only after a crop is detected_?

## Modify Step 6
Look at the conditional statement that is already provided in the code. 

What condition is being evaluated? How can this help us detect plants?

~hint Tell me more!
- Remember: sonar sensors determine how far away an object (like a plant) is by sending out sound waves and measuring how long it takes for them to bounce back. 
- The pre-written conditional statement checks the distance measured by the sonar sensor. It asks if that distance is greater than 0.075 m (7.5 cm).
- In this build, the sensor is about 0.1 m (10 cm) above the ground. If there’s no plant, the sensor will measure a distance of 0.1 m, which triggers the code in the conditional statement.
- If there is a plant, the sensor will measure a distance less than 0.1 m. This triggers the ``||logic:else||`` part of the conditional statement.
hint~

```block
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.075, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

## Modify Step 7
Your task is to move the blocks inside the ``||loops:repeat 4 times||`` loop into the ``||logic:if-then-else||`` block, so that the vehicle only stops to water _when it detects a plant beneath the sonar sensor._

## Modify Step 8
First think about which blocks inside the loop need to be moved into the main part of the conditional statement.

In other words, what should happen when _no plant is present_?

~hint Tell me more!
- When no plant is present, the vehicle should continue to move forward.
hint~

```block
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.075, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        // @highlight
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
    } else {

    }
})
```

## Modify Step 9
Now, think about which blocks inside the loop should be executed when there _is a plant_.

~hint Tell me more!
- When a plant is detected, the vehicle must stop and water the plant.
- Blocks that execute these actions should be placed in the ``||logic:else||`` part of the conditional statement.
hint~

```block
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.075, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {

    } else {
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(2000)
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.stop()
        // @highlight
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(3000)
    }
})
```
## Challenge Time! @showdialog
Let's spend some time optimizing our vehicle to conserve even more water!

## Challenge Step 1
We've arbitrarily chosen 0.075 m as our threshold for plant detection, but you can adjust the distance in the conditional statement to reflect the items you are using to represent plants. 

How far is the top of your "plant" from the sonar sensor? Experiment with different values to find the optimal distance for detecting a plant. What distance allows the vehicle to detect the plant reliably? More reliable detection will lead to increased water savings.

```block
basic.forever(function () {
    // @highlight
    if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.06, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
    } else {
        basic.pause(2000)
        fwdMotors.stop()
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        basic.pause(3000)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 2
Since the water is pumped from the back of the vehicle, it shouldn’t stop as soon as it detects a plant. The vehicle should drive forward slightly prior to turning the pump on.

Adjust how long the vehicle drives after it detects a plant. Experiment with the delay time to find the best setting for effective watering. What delay ensures the plant is watered effectively after detection?

```block
basic.forever(function () {
    // @hightlight
    if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.075, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
        fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 25)
    } else {
        // @highlight
        basic.pause(2000)
        fwdMotors.stop()
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        fwdMotors.pump.fwdTimedRun(1500)
        basic.pause(3000)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 3
Setup a field of "crops" with your objects. Then, run the vehicle with the modified code. 

Observe its behavior. Does it stop to water when it detects a plant? If not, refine your code.

## Challenge Step 4
Consider how much water this prototype will conserve compared to a vehicle that waters continuously or at regular intervals.

How might you mathematically model water usage in this prototype?
