## Activity 1: Build Your Project @showdialog
Let's build a compost tumbler that is powered by the sun! We are going to do this in three parts:
1. **Build** your tumbler
2. **Add code** to your tumbler to bring it to life
3. **Use** your tumbler to learn how it works

## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pluganim.webp" alt="Plug micro:bit into USB port on computer" style="display: block; width: 40%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pairmicrobitGIF.webp"  alt="Pairing gif" style="display: block; width: 60%; margin:auto;">

## Code Step 3
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download the code to your project.

## Activity 3: Use Your Project @showdialog
We are now ready to **use** our compost tumbler!

**Tutorial Tips**

1. **Follow the** steps at the top of the screen.
2. When you are ready for more details, click **'Tell me more!'**
3. If you need help with the code, click the **lightbulb!**

## Use Step 1
Take a close look at the compost tumbler you just built. Can you name the different parts you used to make it? Be specific!

~hint Tell me more!
This tumbler uses:
- **Building Blocks:** One baseplate, one circle, three cube connectors, three medium white frames, two medium white frames with holes for the servo motor, and one thin green frame
- **Robotic Parts:** A breakout board, micro:bit, servo motor, and solar sensor
hint~

## Use Step 2
How do you think all these parts work together to turn our scraps into soil?

~hint Tell me more!
- The **building blocks** create the tumbler that holds the waste. The thin green frame is our door!
- The **motor** spins the tumbler to mix the waste, which helps air get in so the decomposers can break the scraps down.
- The **solar sensor** checks if there is enough sunlight to power the motor. Using sunlight makes the tumbler even more eco-friendly.
hint~

## Use Step 3
How do we make our compost tumbler work?

~hint Tell me more!
- We write code (instructions) that tells the tumbler what to do and save it on our micro:bit.
- When everything is connected, the code is sent from the micro:bit (the brain) to the breakout board (the spine) to the motor and sensors (the limbs). It tells them exactly what to do.
hint~

## Use Step 4
Take a look at the code below. When do you think our tumbler will spin?

Test it out! Were you right?

~hint Tell me more!
- The solar sensor is constantly measuring the amount of light in the environment.
- The tumbler only spins when the solar sensor detects _a lot_ of sunlight (greater than 95%). 
- You can try shining a flashlight on the sensor to see how it works.
hint~

```block
    // @highlight
    while (fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(95, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        // @highlight
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetEnabled(true)
        basic.pause(2000)
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetEnabled(false)
        basic.pause(5000)
    }
```

## Use Step 5
We are using **loops** to check if there is enough light to spin the tumbler. 

Can you identify the two loops in this code?

~hint Tell me more!

Loops make things happen more than once. In this code:

- The ``||basic:forever||`` loop keeps running all the time. It repeats the code inside it over and over. In our project, the forever loop monitors sunlight levels all the time.

- The code inside the ``||loops:while||`` loop runs as long as a certain condition is true. Here, it will only run when the solar sensor detects _enough_ sunlight (more than 95%). 

hint~

```blocks
// @highlight
basic.forever(function () {
    // @highlight
    while (fwdSensors.solar1.fwdIsLightLevelPastThreshold(95, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Over)) {
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetEnabled(true)
        basic.pause(2000)
        fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetEnabled(false)
        basic.pause(5000)
    }
})
```

## Use Step 6
Look back at your project. 

How big is your tumbler? How much waste can it hold?

~hint Tell me more!
- Measure the length, width, and height of your tumbler with a ruler.
- Then, figure out how much waste it can hold by calculating its volume. 
- Remember: Volume = Length x Width x Height
hint~

## Use Step 7
Imagine your school has 720 mL of waste to compost. How many tumblers like yours would you need to compost all of it?

~hint Tell me more!
- Divide 720 mL by your tumbler’s volume.
hint~

## Use Step 8
What if you wanted to make a bigger tumbler to hold 720 mL instead of using a lot of smaller ones?

What size (length, width, height) would your tumbler need to be to hold all 720 mL?

~hint Tell me more!
1. **Know the volume:** Your tumbler needs to hold 720 mL of waste.
2. **Use the volume formula:** Volume = Length × Width × Height.
3. **Guess one side:** Start with a length, like 10 cm. Then pick a width, like 6 cm.
4. **Find the height:** Use the formula to find the height. Divide 720 mL by the product of the other two sides: Height = 720 mL ÷ (10 cm × 6 cm).
5. **Double-check:** Make sure your measurements give you the right volume: 10 cm × 6 cm × 12 cm = 720 mL.
