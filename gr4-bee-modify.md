## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

```template
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})

```
## Code Step 1 @showdialog
 Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.
![pair gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jessica-forwardedu/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/DownloadButtonGIF.webp)

## Code Step 3 
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download the code to your project.

## Activity 3: Modify Your Project @showdialog 
We are ready to modify our bee counter!

Follow the instructions at the top of the screen. When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell me more!'**
After each change, you will need to ``|Download|`` your updated code to your project.

## Modify Step 1 
In this project, we are tracking the number of bees that visit our flower - like a scientist!

We are going to use something called a ``||Variables:Variable||`` to track this number. In this program, our variable is named 'bugVisits'.

~hint Tell me more!
- In coding, we can store information using **variables**. 
- Think of a variable like your piggy bank. Money can go in and out. Whenever you want to know how much money you have, you look inside.
  hint~

## Modify Step 2 
Let's look at variables in action.

What number do you see on the micro:bit right now? What do you think this number means?

~hint Tell me more!
- The number we see on the micro:bit is '0'.
- It is the number of bees that have visited our flower so far.
- We set this number to '0' by putting the ``||variables:set bugVisits to 0||``
  block inside the ``||basic:on start||`` event.
  hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0 
```

## Modify Step 3 
Try changing the number inside the ``||variables:set bugVisits to 0||`` block to something between 1 and 5. What happens? 

~hint Tell me more! 
- The number we see on the micro:bit changes, too.
- Don't see the change? Remember to download the new code. 
 hint~

## Modify Step 4 
Let's press the touch sensor a couple of times. 

What do you see? 

~hint Tell me more!
- Our touch is like a bee landing on the sensor.
- Each time you press the touch sensor, the number shown on the micro:bit goes up by '1'.
- This means the number in our variable is changing by '1'.
- We use a **conditional statement** in our code to make this work. 
hint~


## Modify Step 5 
**Conditional statements** are bits of code that help our micro:bit make decisions. We use conditional statements in our own lives. For example, "If the bell rings at recess, then I line up to go inside!" 

Can you find the conditional statement in our code? Check the lightbulb for the answer!

```block
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
```

## Modify Step 6 

What happens when you increase the number in ``||Variables:change bugVisits by 1||``?  

Try changing it to '3' now, then ``|download|`` the new code.  When you are ready, press the touch sensor.

~hint Tell me more! 
- Now each time you press the touch sensor, the number on the micro:bit goes up by '3'.
- This block changes the number in our variable.
- Remember the piggy bank? It's like when we add money to it!
  hint~


## Modify Step 7 

Now that you've got the hang of how variables work, let's adjust the number in ``||Variables:change bugVisits by 3||`` back to '1' and ``||Variables:set bugVisits to 3||`` to '0' again.

~hint Tell me more!
- We want to count each bee visit as one. 
- Keeping the number at '3' would mix up our count! It's like counting every single bee as 3 bees.
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Activity 4: Challenge @showdialog 
Let's try and use the LED lights! Can you make the LED lights turn on each time a bee lands? 

## Challenge Step 1 
First, we need to control the LED lights. Go to ``||fwdSensors:Sensors||`` and drag  and drop ``||fwdSensors:set all ledRing LEDs to||`` block into the workspace.

~hint Tell me more! 
- Just like a painter picks the right brush for a stroke, we need the right block to control our LED lights.
- This block tells all the LEDs what to do at once.
hint~


## Challenge Step 2 

Now, think about when you want these lights to turn on. After a bee lands, right? Where should we put this block to make that happen?

Use the lightbulb icon to check your work! 

~hint Tell me more!
- Remember, the order in which we place our blocks is very important, just like the steps in a dance routine!
- This block should go right after we count a bee visit, under the ``||variables:change bugVisits by 1||`` block.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 3
Can you make the light turn green? Use the lightbulb icon to check your work! 

~hint Tell me more!
- Don't forget to test your changed code by downloading it!
  hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 4

We’ve got green for go—when bees visit. How about red for when our garden is calm, with no bees around? Let’s grab another ``||fwdSensors:set all ledRing LEDs to||`` block from ``||fwdSensors:Sensors||``. Think about the best spot to place this block.

Check your work against the lightbulb!

~hint Tell me more!
- We want the lights to be a different colour BEFORE a bug visits. This block should be placed within the ``||basic:forever||`` block, above the ``||logic:if then||`` block.
- Don't forget to download your changed code onto the micro:bit.
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```
